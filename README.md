## Dataset
The dataset I chose is of Generation 1 Pok√©mon with known evolution chains by scraping structured HTML from pokemondb.net/evolution, including names, types, and evolution relationships. Every Pok√©mon entry has img URLs corresponding to Gen 5 sprites sourced from pokemondb.net/sprites, and the final data is formatted into a JSON file: pokemon_evolution_data.json

## Data Structures
Arrays: Used to track drawn cards (drawnCards) and pull history (pullHistory), controlling stack-like behavior (.push(), .pop() entries).

Objects (Dictionaries): Grouped cards by type and evolution chain using objects as hash maps (typeGroups, chainsMap), for categorizing.

Sets: Used Set to track unique items (like already revealed stages of an evolution chain) to prevent duplicates.

Traversal: Evolution chains resemble linked nodes. Linear list traversal in both directions (first backward to find the root, then forward to find children).

One of the most challenging aspects of this project was organizing the Pok√©mon into their evolution chains, it resembled a DSA- Leetcode level problem and I already had three days left for this project. Especially when trying to trace the evolution path of each Pok√©mon. I had to iterate through each card, figure out its root, and see that I was correctly mapping its evolution history, all while preventing any loops or missing links. 

I had many variables made for tracking which nodes (or Pok√©mon) I‚Äôd already visited to avoid redundant processing. I also manually cleaned up the dataset so rendered cards looked nice. If I had more time, I‚Äôd refine the logic to accommodate multiple evolution branches, in the case future Pok√©mon with more complex evolution patterns were introduced.
